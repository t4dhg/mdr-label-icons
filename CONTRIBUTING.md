## Adding New Icons

When adding new MDR-compliant icons:

1. **Verify Compliance**: Ensure the icon follows Medical Device Regulation 2017/745 standards
2. **SVG Format**: Icons must be in SVG format
3. **File Naming**: Use kebab-case naming (e.g., `new-icon.svg`)
4. **File Location**: Place SVG files in `src/icons/`
5. **Update Code**: Add the new icon to `src/index.ts`:

```typescript
export const getNewIcon = (): string => {
  return fs.readFileSync(path.join(__dirname, "icons", "new-icon.svg"), "utf8");
};

// Add to icons object
export const icons: Record<string, () => string> = {
  // ...existing icons...
  "new-icon": getNewIcon,
};

// Add to ICON_NAMES constant
export const ICON_NAMES = {
  // ...existing constants...
  NEW_ICON: "new-icon",
} as const;
```

6. **Update Documentation**: Add the new icon to the README.md table
7. **Update Examples**: Include the new icon in usage examples if relevant
